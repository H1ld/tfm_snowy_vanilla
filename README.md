## About The Project
This project is a small game mode for the video game Transformice.
it allows all players to throw snowballs and make it snow in addition of the basic vanilla game mode.

As I knew nothing about lua, I used:
- [The lua tutorial provided by Podoko on the forum](https://atelier801.com/topic?f=6&t=783103&p=1)
- [The lua api provided by Modozap on the forum](https://atelier801.com/topic?f=6&t=543696&p=1)
- [The Transformice wiki](https://transformice.fandom.com/wiki/Lua)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the game [Transformice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/335240/Transformice/) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/H1ld/tfm_snowy_vanilla.git
   ```

2. Run Transformice.
   `steam://rungameid/335240`

3. Enter your tribe house.

4. Type /lua in chat.

5. Copy and paste the content of snowy_vanilla.lua in the popup that opened.

## Usage

Now that the code is running, all mices except the shaman can throw snowballs using the spacebar.
Every time the shaman summons an object, snow will fall.
Players can use the command `!power [number]` to modify the knockback power of snowballs.
